8. **Investment Criteria & Final Selection**
   - **Risk Threshold**: <2.5% probability of loss
   - **Qualifying Region**: Only Region 2 meets risk criteria
   - **Downside Protection**: Region 2 shows positive returns even in worst-case scenarios
   - **Volatility Analysis**: Region 2 demonstrates most consistent performance

## üìà Key Findings & Business Intelligence

- **Model Performance**: Linear regression models successfully predicted oil reserves with reasonable accuracy across all regions

- **Breakeven Challenge**: All regions showed average reserves below the 111.11 thousand barrel breakeven threshold, highlighting the importance of selective well development

- **Top Well Strategy**: Focusing on the top 200 wells (out of 500 explored) transforms unprofitable averages into profitable investments

- **Regional Superiority**: Region 2 demonstrates superior risk-adjusted returns with highest average profit ($4.51M) and lowest loss probability (1.6%)

- **Risk Quantification**: Bootstrap analysis revealed Region 2 as the only region with <2.5% risk of loss, providing crucial downside protection

- **Investment Confidence**: Region 2's 95% confidence interval remains entirely positive ($324K - $8.52M), ensuring profitability even in adverse scenarios
